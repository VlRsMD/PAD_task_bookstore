2. Inside the '7000' folder enter the following command to start the Redis node: 'redis-server ./redis.conf'
3. Repeat steps 1, 2 for each folder in the 'cluster-test' folder
4. Create the cluster with the following command:
'redis-cli --cluster create 127.0.0.1:7000 127.0.0.1:7001 \
127.0.0.1:7002 127.0.0.1:7003 127.0.0.1:7004 127.0.0.1:7005 \
--cluster-replicas 1'
